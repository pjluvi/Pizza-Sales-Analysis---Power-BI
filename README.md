## üìã Background Information
This project analyzes a year's worth of sales data from a fictitious pizza place. The dataset includes information on the date and time of each order, the pizzas served, along with details on their type, size, quantity, price, and ingredients.

## üîç Questions and Recommended Analysis
1. **Customer Traffic**: How many customers do we have each day? Are there any peak hours?
2. **Order Details**: How many pizzas are typically in an order? Do we have any bestsellers?
3. **Revenue Analysis**: How much money did we make this year? Can we identify any seasonality in the sales?
4. **Menu Optimization**: Are there any pizzas we should take off the menu, or any promotions we could leverage?

## üéØ Objectives
- **Customer Traffic Analysis**: Analyze customer traffic trends and identify peak hours to optimize staffing and improve operational efficiency.
